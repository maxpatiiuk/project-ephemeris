## Development

```zsh
npm i       # install dependencies
npm run dev # start development server
```

This would start the development server at
[http://locahlost:3000](http://locahlost:3000).

## Production

```zsh
npm i         # install dependencies
npm run build # begin the build process
npm run start # start production server
```

This would start the production server at
[http://locahlost:3000](http://locahlost:3000).

Afterward, you can deploy this site at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

Alternatively, you can configure a reverse proxy (e.x Nginx) that would handle
the SSL certificate and forward the requests to port 80, which should be made
externally available.

# Code Credit

Majority of the start code was repurposed and reused from another project of
mine: [max.patii.uk (my portfolio)](https://max.patii.uk).

Additionally, some files have been copied/inspired by another project I am a
member of: [Specify 7](http://github.com/specify/specify7).
